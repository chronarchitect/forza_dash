# Forza Horizon 5 Telemetry API

A simple flask API which takes data from Forza Horizon 5's data out port and converts it into a usable JSON format.

Listens on port 5300 on all interfaces, can be used on a different device as well just specify the IP in-game.

This is the first commit, documentation and stuff is on the way
All I can say rn is if you run this app while horizon is running, you can make API calls and get JSON response
